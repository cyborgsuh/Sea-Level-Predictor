## Sea-Level-Predictor

Embarking on a thrilling quest for knowledge, this groundbreaking project was part of the FreeCodeCamp certification journey. Exploring not one, but two exhilarating approaches to predicting sea level, we delved deep into the annals of data, spanning back to the depths of 1880 and leaping forward to the contemporary records of 2013. Armed with the formidable tools of SciPy and Sklearn, we unleashed the power of regression models in a quest to unravel the mysteries of the ever-changing tides.
